          I am a Web Developer who looks to provide a source of power and value for a growth oriented company.  Being ambitious, I crave rapid growth and realized that I needed to go into the entrepreneur and tech world.
Having built a start-up and realizing I needed more development skills, I tried my hand at HTML and CSS and I couldn't get enough of watching a website develop and build with every piece of code I added.
I wanted more, so I signed up for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive offering me the tools I need to build a fully functioning website and application.
